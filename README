NAME
    CautiousDBI - Guards against fetchrow_array[ref] returning lists poulated with undef values.

SYNOPSIS
      use CautiousDBI;
      my $dbh = CautiousDBI->connect("dbi:SQLite:dbname=$dbfile","","");

DESCRIPTION
    In-place replacement for DBI which guards against fetchrow_array[ref]
    calls that return lists populated with undef rather than empty lists.

    Lists containing undef values will evaluate to true in this while loop:
        while(my @row = $sth->fetchrow_array) { ... }
    which result in an infinite loop.
